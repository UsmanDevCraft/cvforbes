# ✨ Product Vision

Most job seekers send the same resume to hundreds of companies.

Modern Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) don't simply look for experience—they look for relevance.

CVForbes bridges that gap by intelligently rewriting existing resumes to emphasize the skills, technologies, and achievements most relevant to each specific job description without fabricating information.

Our goal is simple:

> **One Resume. Unlimited Opportunities.**

# 🧠 Frontend Architecture

The application follows modern React best practices.

## State Management

* React Hooks
* TanStack Query
* Formik

## API Layer

Dedicated service layer keeps networking separate from UI components.

## Validation

All user input is validated using **Zod** before submission.

## Component Design

Reusable components are designed to be composable and maintainable.

---

# 🔒 Security Considerations

Although the primary security layer lives in the backend, the frontend also contributes by:

* Validating form inputs before submission
* Restricting unsupported file formats
* Enforcing upload size limits
* Preventing invalid requests
* Handling API failures gracefully
* Displaying user-friendly error messages

The backend performs the authoritative validation and security checks.

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations

The frontend includes several optimizations:

* Dynamic imports
* Code splitting
* Lazy loading
* Optimized rendering
* React Query request caching
* Lightweight component architecture
* Efficient state updates
* Responsive image handling
* Suspense boundaries
* Modern Next.js App Router
